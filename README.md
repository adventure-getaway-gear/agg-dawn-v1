# Adventure Getaway Gear

This is the Adventure Getaway Gear Shopify theme project, built on the Dawn framework.

## Purpose

To create a customized Shopify storefront for Adventure Getaway Gear, focusing on performance, design, and modular development.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/agg-dawn-v1.git`

2. Open in VS Code and install dependencies (if needed).

3. Use GitHub Desktop to stage changes and push to `main` or `adventure-getaway-gear-staging`.

## Workflow

- Use PowerShell 7 for local development.
- Stage changes only (`git add`), commit/push via GitHub Desktop.
- Follow naming conventions: `pro_agg_` prefix, schema/preset display names start with `PRO-AGG `.

## Context Preservation

This README is used by Chris and Copilot Pro to preserve context and guide development. It serves as a reference for project setup, workflow, and naming conventions.
